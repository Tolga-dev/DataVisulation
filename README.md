# Data Visualization for Migration Trends

This repository contains interactive visualizations designed to explore migration trends globally, focusing on immigration, emigration, and refugee movements from 1995 to today. Using various types of data visualizations, including choropleth maps and bar charts, the goal is to present insightful trends and comparisons in the migration data across different countries and years.

## Key Features:
- **Choropleth Maps**: Visualize migration data (immigration, emigration, refugees) on a world map, with color gradients representing the volume of migrants and refugees for each country.
- **Bar Charts**: Yearly breakdown of the top countries for immigration, emigration, and refugees, highlighting the most significant migration flows.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Users can explore the migration trends year by year using dynamic sliders to change the year and see how trends evolve over time.

## Key Questions Answered:
- **Which countries have the highest immigration and emigration from 1995 to today?**
- **What are the refugee trends year by year by country of origin?**
- **How has immigration, emigration, and refugee statistics evolved over the years?**

These visualizations help to better understand migration patterns, supporting data-driven decisions for policy, research, and educational purposes.

## Technologies Used:
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations, including choropleth maps and bar charts.
- **Dash**: A Python framework for building web-based applications, used to integrate the visualizations with interactive elements.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and manipulation.
- **GeoJSON**: For displaying geographical data in choropleth maps.

This repository is intended for use by data analysts, researchers, or anyone interested in exploring migration trends on a global scale.
